    <p>This project explores the idea of archiving my wardrobe as a personal zine — a visual and written collection that
        documents my relationship with clothes. By turning my wardrobe into an archive, I aim to glance back at myself
        through the garments I’ve worn, saved, or outgrown. Each piece holds a trace of time, emotion, and identity,
        becoming a small reflection of who I was in different moments. The zine is both a self-portrait and a study of
        material memory, where fashion becomes a language of personal history. </p>
